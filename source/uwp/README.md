# Adaptive Cards in UWP

This directory contains the renderers and tooling for the UWP platform. 

## Requirements

1. Visual Studio 2017 with C++ tooling

## Why C++?

Since Adaptive Cards are hosted directly within the Windows OS we had implementation requirements to use strictly unmanaged code. 

## How to test

To run the test project, see the [AdaptiveCardTestApp](AdaptiveCardTestApp/README.md) folder
