# Completed features

Once a spec has been implemented, we need to do a few things.


## Notifying requesting partners

Whoever had the initial requirements for the feature needs to be notified, so that they can try out the new feature. On each of their requirement issues, we'll post comments stating that we've reached out, etc, so that we know they've been informed.


## Validating with partners

After we've told the partner about the new feature, we need their validation that it indeed satisifes their requirements. Once this validiation is received, we'll close their requirement issue.
