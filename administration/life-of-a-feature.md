# The life of a feature

![life of a feature, animated](images/life-of-a-feature.gif)

## Requests come in...

Partners say "We need XYZ!"

* We capture these individual requests as described in [the requests page](requests.md).


## We group requests into a requests collection

So that we can easily see a set of common requirements asked for by multiple partners, we create a requests collection, as described in [the requests page](requests.md).


## Proposal(s) are authored

Invested parties author proposals to solve the requirements, as described in [the proposals page](proposals.md).


## Proposal(s) are reviewed (4+ days)

The proposals are reviewed, as described in [the proposals page](proposals.md).


## Proposal approved, becomes spec draft

If the proposal is approved, it becomes a spec draft, where more fine grain details must be provided, to have a solid, unambiguous spec that developers can implement. Learn more on [the specs page](specs.md).


## Spec is reviewed (4+ days)

The spec is reviewed, as described in [the specs page](specs.md).


## Spec is approved

If the spec is approved, it is ready to be implemented!


## Devs implement feature

The feature is coded up and added to the renderers!


## Validate feature with partners

Now, we go back to our original requests, and have our partners validate the new feature to confirm that it meets their requirements.
